# Simple CRUD Application

This is a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application that I built as my first project using Node.js for the backend, React.js for the frontend, and MongoDB as the database. The application demonstrates basic data operations, allowing users to create, view, update, and delete records.
