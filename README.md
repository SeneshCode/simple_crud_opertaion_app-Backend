# Simple CRUD Application

This is a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application that I built as my first project using Node.js for the backend, React.js for the frontend, and MongoDB as the database. The application demonstrates basic data operations, allowing users to create, view, update, and delete records.

## Features

- **Create**: Add new records to the database.
- **Read**: Retrieve and display records from the database.
- **Update**: Edit existing records.
- **Delete**: Remove records from the database.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Frontend**: React.js
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Other Tools**: Mongoose (for MongoDB interactions), Axios (for making HTTP requests from React to Node.js)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js**: [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- **npm** (Node Package Manager): Installed with Node.js
- **MongoDB**: [Download MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) or use [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) for a cloud-based database.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SeneshCode/simple_crud_opertaion_app-react-js-node-js-.git

2. **Backend Setup:**

- Navigate to the backend directory:

bash
```bash
cd backend
```
- Install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
Copy code
npm install
```
- Configure your MongoDB connection string in the server.js file.

Start the backend server:

```bash
Copy code
npm start
```

The backend server should now be running on http://localhost:1574.
```bash
not privide yet front end for gide line correctly
```


Frontend Setup:

Navigate to the frontend directory:

bash
Copy code
cd ../frontend
Install the necessary dependencies:

bash
Copy code
```
npm install
```
Start the frontend development server:


bash
Copy code
```
npm start
```
The frontend should now be running on http://localhost:3000.

Usage
Once both the backend and frontend servers are running, you can:

Open your browser and go to http://localhost:3000 to interact with the application.
Perform CRUD operations via the user interface:
Create a new record by filling out the form and submitting it.
View records listed on the page.
Update existing records by editing and submitting the changes.
Delete records by clicking the delete button.
API Endpoints
```
GET /api/users: Retrieve all users.
POST /api/users: Create a new user.
PUT /api/users/:id: Update an existing user.
DELETE /api/users/:id: Delete a user.
```
These endpoints are consumed by the React frontend using Axios.
